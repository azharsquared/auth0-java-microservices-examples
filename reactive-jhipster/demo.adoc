Today, I'd like to show you how to use JHipster 8 to create a reactive Java microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Gateway, and Spring WebFlux.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 17]+
- https://nodejs.org/[Node 18]+
- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]

=== Build a Reactive Java Microservices Architecture

In this demo, I'll show you how to generate a microservice architecture that uses OAuth 2.0, an API gateway, and two microservices (a blog and a store). The gateway will use PostgreSQL with R2DBC, the blog will use Neo4j, and the store will use MongoDB.

. Install JHipster 8 from its `main` branch:
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster.git
cd generator-jhipster
npm install
npm link
----

. Create a directory called `reactive-stack` and initialize `git`.
+
[source,shell]
----
take reactive-stack # mkdir reactive-stack && cd reactive-stack
git init # initialize git, so apps aren't created with their own .git
----

. Import the `reactive-ms` architecture definition from the https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples[jdl-samples repository] and generate `gateway`, `blog`, and `store` apps.
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl
----
+
As part of this process, several Docker Compose files are generated for you. These allow you to run databases, the https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/[JHipster Registry] (for service discovery), https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] (for identity), all with Docker.

=== Run Your Reactive Java Microservices

. Run the following commands to start Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and the JHipster Registry.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d #jhkeycloakup
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup
./gradlew
----
+
TIP: JHipster has an https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/[Oh My ZSH! plugin] that I highly recommend. It provides aliases for starting Docker containers and is a real time-saver. I've included these commands as comments above.

. Open a new terminal window, start the blog app's Neo4j database, and then the app itself.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ../blog
docker compose -f src/main/docker/neo4j.yml up -d #jhneo4jup
./gradlew
----

. Open another terminal window, start the store app's MongoDB database, and the microservice.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ../store
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d #jhmongoup
./gradlew
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux, `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).

----
127.0.0.1	keycloak
----

This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or `127.0.0.1`), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named `keycloak`.
====

. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser. You should be able to log in with `admin/admin` as credentials.

. To prove everything works, you can run `npm run e2e` in the gateway project's directory. This will run a number of end-to-end tests with https://www.cypress.io/[Cypress].

=== Prepare Your Reactive Java Stack for Production

Keycloak is a superb open source identity provider. It has excellent support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) and easily runs in a Docker container. I greatly appreciate Keycloak's ease-of-use. I also ❤️ Spring Security's OAuth and OIDC support.

Spring Security makes it so you only need to override three properties to switch from Keycloak to Auth0!

Spring Cloud Gateway makes it easy to relay an access token between a gateway and microservices. It's just five lines of YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay
----

. Install the https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli[Auth0 CLI] and run `auth0 login`.

. In the gateway project's directory, run the command below. Accept the default redirect URIs.
+
[source,shell]
----
auth0 apps create
----
+
Use the following values when prompted:

- Name: `Reactive Stack`
- Type: `Regular Web Application`
- Callback URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `\http://localhost:8080`

. In the https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles[roles] section or your Auth0 dashboard, create new roles named `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`.

. Create a new user account in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/users[users] section. Click the *Role* tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure your new user's email is verified before attempting to log in!

. Next, head to **Actions** > **Flows** and select **Login**. Create a new action named `Add Roles` and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the `onExecutePostLogin` handler to be as follows:
+
[source,js]
----
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}
----
+
Select **Deploy** and drag the `Add Roles` action to your Login flow.

==== Update the JHipster Registry to Distribute OIDC Configuration

Spring Cloud Config allows you to distribute Spring's configuration between apps. In this section, you'll configure JHipster's Spring Security settings to use Auth0 across all your services.

. Add the following YAML to `gateway/src/main/docker/central-server-config/localhost-config/application.yml`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
jhipster:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      audience:
        - https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://<your-auth0-domain>/
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
----

. Save your changes and restart the JHipster Registry:
+
[source,shell]
----
jhregistrydown
jhregistryup
----

. Use kbd:[Ctrl + C] to kill all your `./gradlew` processes and start them again.

. Open an incognito window, go to `http://localhost:8080`, and sign in. Rejoice that using Auth0 for authentication works!

. If you're feeling lucky, you can set your Auth0 credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests (from the `gateway` directory).
+
[source,shell]
----
export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=<your-username>
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=<your-password>
npm run e2e
----

=== Create Docker Images for Your Microservice Apps

. Stop all your apps with kbd:[Ctrl + C]. Stop all your Docker instances too.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
----
+
TIP: Bump up the memory and CPU that Docker uses in Docker > Preferences > Resources. I have my Docker preferences set to 6 CPUs and 32GB of RAM.

. To run your reactive stack with Docker Compose, you need to create Docker images for each app. In your three different app directories, run the following Gradle command:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild -PjibArchitecture=arm64
----

=== Run Your Microservices Stack with Docker Compose

Once your Docker containers are finished building, you'll want to add your Auth0 settings to Spring Cloud Config in JHipster Registry.

. Update `docker compose/central-server-config/application.yml` to contain your OIDC settings that you want to share with all your microservices.

. In the `docker-compose` directory, run the following command to start all your containers.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker compose up
----

. Open `http://localhost:8080`, sign in, and access all of your microservices. Pretty slick, eh?! 🤓

== Micro Frontends with JHipster

. Download `reactive-mf.jdl` and compare it to `reactive-ms.jdl` in IntelliJ IDEA. You'll need IDEA's https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html[Command-line Launcher] for the `idea` command to work.
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster download reactive-mf.jdl
idea diff reactive-ms.jdl reactive-mf.jdl
----
+
TIP: The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19697-jhipster-jdl[JHipster JDL Plugin] is a handy tool for working with JDL files.

. Generate a microservices architecture with micro frontend support:
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --monorepository --workspaces
----

== What About Kotlin Microservices?

JHipster supports Kotlin-based microservices thanks to its https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin[Kotlin blueprint], supported by https://github.com/sendilkumarn[Sendil Kumar N].

You can install it using npm:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin
----

Then, use `khipster jdl reactive-ms` to create the same stack you did above with Kotlin.

== Stay Hip with JHipster!
